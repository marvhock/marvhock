The motivation to create this site was mainly to provide lecture scripts for my students, as well as a place where they 
can re-read stuff from my lessons or get additional theoretical input or practical examples. 

I prefer reading and structuring information like websites or wikis do, so I decided Iâ€™ll maintain and provide the 
information I can give in the same way instead manually handing out PDF scripts. You will find all that in german only 
for now under [Unterricht](/unterricht).

Additionally sharing some knowledge about specific topics will sporadically appear in the [Blog](/blog) section here.
I think its also a good opportunity to have a well written and structured explanation about a specific topic at hand, 
which you can easily share with colleagues and people interested.

Topics will mainly be about web development and related subjects.
