I am a frontend developer based in Bochum, Germany.  
As a developer, I am fascinated by simple solutions and human readable code. I also have a passion for good UI design.

On a typical working day, you will see me hacking some sass and vanilla js into a symfony codebase, making impressive puns ðŸ¤” and watching out for interesting meetups.

For the future, I am looking forward to thankfully contribute back to the open source community and improve myself as a teacher for the next generation of web developers.
